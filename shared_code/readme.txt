This a small note regarding the hybrid identification task. 

Useful material: 
1. HIT toolbox http://sisdin.unipv.it/lab/personale/pers_hp/ferrari/HIT_toolbox.php
2. Installation instructions https://gist.github.com/nikos-kekatos/d25fd4f8457031115cd97fb7ff61413b
3. Log with results https://docs.google.com/document/d/17dOOdoscMSb1UnHjsmZ4qx9_nYAHCibHAvBeCyfHBqk/edit

Requirements:
MATLAB, optimization toolbox, MPC (only if you want to regenerate the traces)

Usage:
run section after section (to check the steps)

Goal:
evaluate different clustering options 

Remark:
1. Do not close autogenerated Figures, e.g.  Figure 11 since MATLAB might hang.
2. Scenarios 1 and 2 take a few minutes, everything else takes only seconds.
